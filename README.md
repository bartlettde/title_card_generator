## Prerequisite
- Tkinter
- PIL
- CV2

## How to Use
- Run the python script
- Click once on canvas to start a line, click again to finish the line
- Use the backspace key to undo a line
- Once happy, hit the spacebar
- It may take a few seconds to create the frames
- Look in the project folder to see the outputed .mp4 file

## Personalisation
I tried to go over-the-top with comments to make it easy for non-programmers to go through the code, understand what is happening and change it to work for them. If you have any questions, please feel free to open an issue.
- See line 28 in the code to change the output folder
- See lines 31 and 32 to change the colour of the background and the lines

## Contributing
Pull requests are very welcome. This was a quick project and this is a rough prototype with plenty of potential improvements.
